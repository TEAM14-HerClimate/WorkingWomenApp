## âœ… Problem It Solves

Women in their reproductive age (15-49 years) working in the informal sector NEED childcare facilities, safe and clean working environment, access to health care and  legal protection BECAUSE their reproductive health needs are not prioritised which has exposed them to the negative effects of climate change on the environment like extreme heat conditions, pollution, chemical exposure, floods, water scarcity, poor sanitation, and climate migration.
